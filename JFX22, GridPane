Again, no real coding here, just observations from BroCode's video:

We're still looking at panes which are more rigid in nature than the AnchorPane we've been using all through. 
The next one we'll briefly discuss is GridPane.

In SceneBuilder, one can right click on the GridPane itself and add and delete rows and columns.
Within "Layout", one can change the alignment of a node within a cell in the grid. 
You can even change the node's dimensions, but its maximum will always be within the cell it's in.
"Layout" also lets you change the width and height of each cell, which will also make the node change its dimensions accordingly(proportionally).
In "Properties", you can tick "GridLines Visible" to, well, make the lines between each cell visible.
Back to "Layout"- like in FlowPane, you can also change the horizontal and vertical gap between each cell as you see fit.
