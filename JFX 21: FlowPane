No real coding here, just observations from BroCode's explanations:

Looking at the FXML file shows that in ALL cases so far, we've been using an AnchorPane, which allows us to place components basically wherever we want.
What if you wanted a more rigid layout though? Well enter the: FlowPane!
This one makes ALL components within (no matter how much you attempt to place them differently) follow each other, either horizontally or vertically. 
That can be set within SceneBuilder "Properties".
Still within "Properties", you can state whether you want your components to start from top-left (typical),
or from top-right, centre, centre-left, whatever your app needs for the situation
Should you want a gap between your components, you go to "Layout" and choose HorizontalGap||Hgap  or VerticalGap||Vgap, depending on which orientation you chose earlier.
