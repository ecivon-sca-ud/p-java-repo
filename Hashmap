        A HashMap is a data structure, just like arrays and Arraylists. The key difference is that this one uses
        key-value pairs, making them convenient for storing two sets of closely related data, like countries and
        their respective capitals. They are more user friendly in this sense, but for the programmer they need to:
        1. use the import statement written above.
        2. use a wrapper class, since you're looking to use a HashMap to store objects, which are also reference
        datatypes, like the wrapper classes like Integer, Character,...
